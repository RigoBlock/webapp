# Private Docker register installation

These guide will set-up a private Docker register at https://docker-register.endopoint.network

Create a directory `rb-docker-register` in `/home/rigoblock`. We will store scripts, images and other configuration files in there. 

    mkdir /home/rigoblock/rb-docker-register

Copy the content of `cert/` and `auth/` in the newly created directory.
